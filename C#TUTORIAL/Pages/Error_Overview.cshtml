        <p class="f_size">
            An exception is a problem that arises during the execution of a program. A C# exception is a response to an exceptional
             circumstance that arises while a program is running, such as an attempt to divide by zero.</p>

        <p class="f_size">Exceptions provide a way to transfer control from one part of a program to another. C# exception handling is
             built upon four keywords: try, catch, finally, and throw.</p>

        <p class="f_size">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>&#x2022;</b>try − A try block identifies a block of code for which particular exceptions is activated. It is followed by one or more catch blocks.</br>
            &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>&#x2022;</b>catch − A program catches an exception with an exception handler at the place in a program where you want to handle the problem. The catch keyword indicates the catching of an exception.</br>
            &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>&#x2022;</b>finally − The finally block is used to execute a given set of statements, whether an exception is thrown or not thrown. For example, if you open a file, it must be closed whether an exception is raised or not.</br>
            &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>&#x2022;</b>throw − A program throws an exception when a problem shows up. This is done using a throw keyword.            
            </p></br></br>

        <h5>Exceptions Overview</h5>
        <p class="f_size">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>&#x2022;</b>Exceptions are types that all ultimately derive from System.Exception.</br>
                &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>&#x2022;</b>Use a try block around the statements that might throw exceptions.</br>
                &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>&#x2022;</b>If no exception handler for a given exception is present, the program stops executing with an error message.</br>
                &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>&#x2022;</b>Exceptions can be explicitly generated by a program by using the throw keyword.</br>
                &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>&#x2022;</b>Exception objects contain detailed information about the error, such as the state of the call stack and a text description of the error.</br>
