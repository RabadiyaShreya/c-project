    <center><h1><b>Top-level statements - programs without Main methods</b></h1></center>
    <p class="p1">you can use the top-level statements feature to minimize the code you have to write. 
       In this case, the compiler generates a class and Main method entry point for the application.</p>
    <p class="p1">
        Top-level statements let you write simple programs for small utilities such as Azure Functions and GitHub Actions.
        They also make it simpler for new C# programmers to get started learning and writing code.
    </p>
    <p class="p1">A file with top-level statements can also contain namespaces and type definitions, but they must come after the top-level statements</p>
